## Stack/Technologies

- React.js : Fast, scalable, simple, allows us to create reusable components
- Redux (Thunk) : allows to dispatch actions asynchronously and resolve each promise that gets returned
- Material-UI : Faster development, popular and well documented

This project also includes `axios` which is more customizable and gives all the methods to work with the api requests.

## Trade-off / Future Work 
- Feature : Feature like directions from current location to destination, detailed view of the restaurant, custom pin etc could be added.
- Error Handling : Write methods to handle any type of error from the client.
- Test : Component/integration testing could be added.
- Ui : More colorful and attractive ui
